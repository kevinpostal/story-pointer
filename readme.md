ZG Story Pointer
=========

An initial prototype and first stab at meteorJS

> I had a lot of fun making this app. At ZG, the engineering team often gathers in order to estimate the value of Jira Tickets. Because we are both working with in-house and remote teams, there is often an akward stage during the estimation process where we all take time just to check if everyone is ready to cast their vote. This app increases our efficiency by allowing us to see in real time who has voted, and who has yet to vote. Once every team-members vote is in, everyones votes are revealed and we are able to further discuss the point value of the ticket.

> This was my first time building anything with meteorJS. Coming from an AngularJS world, I was orignally flustered and frustrated by this strange new framework. However, by the end of the night I was able to realize that meteor had a lot of merit to it. For rapid prototyping it's excellent because it scaffolds what normally takes a lot of time quickly. User login and web sockets all come baked in. There is surely a better way to modularize and structure the project, but for an initial build that was done over the course of 6 hours in a foreign framework - I'm happy with it. The philosophy behind this app is what really drove me through the night to build it. Not only was I able to learn a new javascript framework but I also created a tool that was able to benefit our team as a whole. 2 Birds, 1 stone.
